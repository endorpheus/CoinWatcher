## CoinWatcher Ideas

- [ ] add real color overlay to tray icon based on ticker color
- [ ] ignore the timer and just call the API when a new crypto coin is selected
- [X] fix slider labels
- [X] fix redundancies
- [ ] add support for multiple exchanges
- [ ] fix missing icons
- [X] move icons to icons folder
- [ ] add more granularity:
    - price precision (like sub-cent amounts, i.e. Shiba-inu: ~0.000019)
    - Ticker symbol clarity (like SHIB: "Shiba-inu") convertability
- [ ] add more crypto coins via API / dropdown list?
    - allow searchable coin list with information like: name, symbol, price, etc.

## Chit-Chat
I've tried to keep it simple. There are plenty of full scale crypto websites like CoinGecko, Coinbase, etc. that can be used for this type of thing.  But this is for the taskbar!

I just wanted an "at a glance" view of the prices of various crypto coins.

I have another project I'm working on, which does something similar.
It isn't out of the realm of possibility that the other project and this one could be combined.  It's not a priority.

Let's see how it goes.
