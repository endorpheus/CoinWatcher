## CoinWatcher Ideas

- [ ] fix the floating window class to catch a parameter for width and height user preferences settings
- [ ] add support for multiple exchanges
- [ ] fix missing icons
- [ ] move icons to icons folder
- [ ] add more granularity:
    - price precision (like sub-cent amounts, i.e. Shiba-inu: ~0.000019)
    - Ticker symbol clarity (like SHIB: "Shiba-inu") convertability
- [ ] add more crypto coins
    - allow searchable coin list, with information like: name, symbol, price, etc.

## Chit-Chat
In an attempt to keep it simple and minimal, I don't really want to overcomplicate it. There are plenty of full scale crypto websites like CoinGecko, Coinbase, etc. that can be used for this.

I just wanted an "at a glance" view of the prices of various crypto coins.

I have another project that does something similar that I'm working on.
It isn't out of the realm of possibility that the other project and this one could be combined.  It's not a priority.

Let's see how it goes.
